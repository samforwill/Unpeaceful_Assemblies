The demonstration, which began peacefully, spread out and looting of multiple stores began to take place. At one point there was a gun battle in which two people were shot and killed and two others were wounded by gunfire, including a police officer. A 21-year old man was arrested later in June. He knew one of the victims and they had allegedly a dispute over Facebook posts. Among those shot dead was a woman who was leaving the demonstration.

About 100 people counter-demonstrated in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, against police brutality, and against the death of George Floyd. During the demonstration, demonstrators engaged in verbal and physical confrontations. Back the Blue demonstrators reportedly assaulted a BLM supporter while BLM demonstrators reportedly threw eggs at the police and pro-police demonstrators. Various other minor clashes were reported.

A 'much smaller' group of Azeri people counter demonstrated. Verbal altercations ensued and police responded. Allegedly, an Azeri demonstrator 'knocked out' an Armenian demonstrator by hitting her with a flagpole. Afterwards, multiple physical altercations occurred. Three people were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries from being 'punched or kicked.' A total of seven people were injured, five of whom were hospitalized.\n",

Anti-racist and antifa demonstrators held a counter demonstration, organized by an Atlanta-based frontline organization working to end racism, FLOWER. Other groups, including NAACP, but also far-left anarchists and socialists, some of them heavily armed, also participated at the demonstration. Many of them wore Black Lives Matter t-shirts. After hours of shouting, and the burning of a Confederate flag, the event devolved into scuffles and small-scale fist fights and pepper spraying (amongst demonstrators). Police backed by a SWAT team and the Georgia National Guard intervened and dispersed the demonstrators from both side. Some demonstrators were lightly injured.\n",

Following an initially peaceful 'Stop the Steal' march, people including Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters (III%) began rioting and fighting with other demonstrators. The two opposing groups engaged in fist fights and some people set off fireworks and sprayed irritants. Others used clubs and launched projectiles. A Trump supporter drove through the crowd with his car, but no one was injured. Multiple people were stabbed, including one reporter. One person was stabbed and taken to the hospital with serious injuries, but no information is available about the victim or the perpetrator. Four officers were also injured. Police attempted to disperse demonstrators with pepper spray and arrested at least 21 people.\n",

An unreported number of President Trump supporters including the Proud Boys gathered outside the California State Capitol in support of President Trump and his unfounded allegations of voter fraud. Approximately 150 police officers stood between the two groups. Some Antifa demonstrators attempted to remove a barrier, which allegedly led to police firing 'projectile weapons at them at point-blank range.' Demonstrators with both groups allegedly threw fireworks, glass bottles, and liquids at each other. Some Antifa demonstrators reportedly vandalized cars in the area. A group of Antifa demonstrators followed several pro-Trump demonstrators into Capitol Park where Antifa demonstrators allegedly instigated a physical confrontation using batons and bottles against a man and woman. Both the man and woman were pro-Trump demonstrators and allegedly sprayed mace in response. Other Antifa demonstrators attempted to pull the initial perpetrators away from the altercation. Police reported that they used pepper ball irritants during the demonstration and that no arrests were made.\n",

Fights broke out between the two groups in several areas of the city. Pro-Trump demonstrators removed a BLM flag from outside the Asbury United Methodist Church and burned the flag. Police reported that three other churches were vandalized by the pro-Trump supporters. The vandalism incidents are being treated as hate crimes. People with BLM shot fireworks at the Trump demonstrators. Demonstrators also clashed with the police and hurled smoke bombs and water bottles at them. Police pepper sprayed demonstrators to disperse them. During an incident outside a bar dozens of pro-Trump supporters including members of Proud Boys punched and kicked a Black man in dark clothes. During the assault, the man reportedly produced a knife and stabbed the assailants, leaving four people with non life-threatening injuries. He was initially charged for the stabbings, but the police ultimately dropped the charges. A total of 33 people were arrested. A total of 8 police officers were also injured during the demonstrations.\n",

Another group which included members of New York's Jewish and Israeli communities conducted a pro-Israel demonstration in support of the Israeli government. The event was largely peaceful, but some members in both groups fought each other, with one pro-Israeli demonstrator being injured. It was unclear how he sustained his injuries and no one was arrested.\n",

They gathered outside the Hyatt Hotel where The Colorado Christian University Centennial Institute's 2021 Western Conservative Summit was being held. The leftist group blocked traffic, threw a bottle at a car, brawled with passerby, and got into shouting matches with others. Some members of Proud Boys showed up and had a physical scuffle with the demonstrators. After the participants of the conservative summit left, hundreds of racist flyers with swastikas were found in the vicinity. The 'Antifa-BLM Summit' was organized by the Denver Communists, Front Range Mutual Aid Network, WITCH Denver, Front Range Community Defense Collective, Anon Resistance Movements, Anti-Repression Colorado, Denver Action Network - an anarchist group unaffiliated with the National Action Network. Armed members of the far-right FEC United and the United Armed Defense Force provided security for the conservative summit and stood opposite the leftist demonstrators.\n",

The demonstration was led by an anti-LGBT pastor. Dozens of counter-demonstrators, including Antifa and people dressed in black bloc, threw smoke grenades and damaged the group's audio equipment. The demonstrators tried to relocate elsewhere in the park, but the counter-demonstrators followed. Once the event was concluded, demonstrators armed with paintball guns, batons and other weapons standing guard at the event clashed with counter-demonstrators. Demonstrators fired paintball guns and counter-demonstrators used pepper spray. A counter-demonstrator and bystander reported being shot in the face with paintballs. The bystander claimed that, prior to being shot with a paintball, an individual armed with an M16 rifle aimed the gun at his face before another person (who was in the same vehicle as the armed individual) deterred the gunman.\n",

Some demonstrators wore apparel supporting former President Donald Trump and some demonstrators also rallied in support of the Back the Blue movement and law enforcement. A few dozen counter-demonstrators staged a 'No Safe Space For Fascists' rally in support of mandatory coronavirus vaccines. A physical altercation broke out between the two groups. Two people were stabbed, one with the larger group who was hospitalized with 'a lacerated heart and punctured lung' and other who sustained less serious wounds.

Some demonstrators held signs with the phrase 'Let's Go Brandon' (a slogan against President Biden).

      "48692    On 23 October 2022, dozens of people, including Christian groups with signs reading 'Antifa Protects Pedophiles,' Proud Boys, memers of Rose City Nationalists, and others who performed Nazi salutes, gathered for a demonstration outside Old Nick's Pub in Eugene (Oregon) during a 'Drag Queen Brunch Story Hour' to demonstrate against 'pedophiles,' 'child abuse,' and LGBT+ rights. Police stated that some of the anti-LGBT+ demonstrators were armed. At least one of the demonstrators was immediately identified as holding a paintball gun. Another group of hundreds of people, including members of the LGBT+ community and armed anti-fascists, who held a banner reading 'Protect Trans Youth,' gathered in support of transgender rights. Anti-LGBT+ demonstrators attempted to enter the event without purchasing tickets, and began to throw rocks after they were refused entry. Police instructed the anti-LGBT+ group to move away from the area. As the anti-LGBT+ demonstrators backed slowly away from the event, pro-LGBT+ counter-demonstrators pushed forward. Video appeared to show an anti-fascist roughly pushing an individual to the ground. As the pro-LGBT+ counter-demonstrators continued to push forward, chanting 'move back,' an anti-LGBT+ demonstrator sprayed mace into the air, leading to fighting between the groups. Anti-LGBT+ demonstrators shot paintball guns, used mace, and threw smoke bombs. The pro-LGBT+ crowd, meanwhile, threw rocks. One man was sent to the hospital with injuries that were not immediately clear, and at least 1 journalist was maced by the anti-LGBT+ demonstrators during the interaction.\n",

Among the demonstrators were members of the Penn State student anti-Fascists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. The demonstration was organized by SCDS: Student Committee for Defense and Solidarity. A group of Proud Boys was also present to counter the student demonstrators. At some point during the demonstration, a student was arrested after he managed to move from the crowd of demonstrators to behind horse-mounted officers, 'caused a horse to react,' and refused to return to the crowd. The event was later canceled due to 'escalating violence.' In one instance, a member of the Proud Boys fought with a demonstrator in an incident that the Proud Boy initiated. In another instance, a pro-event counter-demonstrator affiliated with White Lives Matter sprayed mace at about a dozen demonstrators and a journalist.\n",

A female nurse was reportedly punched and her car was vandalized after she encountered the group. Demonstrators alleged she drove through the crowd purposefully, although this was contradicted by video of the incident. Demonstrators claimed that a teenager on a bicycle was injured by the driver but 'no victims have come forward.' No arrests were reported.\n",

During the demonstration, shots were fired nearby, and the crowd cleared to about 50 people. It is unclear who fired the shots or if anyone was injured in the incident. The heavily armed group that remained attacked two people in a car along the street - reaching inside the car, slapping the driver, and breaking a window with a rock. The two people in the car were injured. Those in the car were believed to be driving to a second location when the attack began. It is not clear if the assailants were demonstrating beforehand. A journalist who was present was also approached by the armed group and was repeatedly punched in the head after refusing to hand over his phone. The journalist had lacerations and severe bruising on his face and had to have a cut above his eye glued shut.\n",

The city's Public Safety Director claims that two city-employed tow truck drivers were assaulted by demonstrators, saying one driver was hit in the face with a rifle and the other was punched. Police are looking to arrest two suspects. Demonstrators disputed this version of events by saying that their intervention was non-violent, and that only one individual was armed. One arrest was made on the same day regarding the incident. In addition, a demonstrator at the event reportedly attacked another demonstrator, causing injuries.\n",

      "23511    On 6 January 2021, hundreds of people, including Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson, gathered outside the State Capitol in Olympia (Washington) to demonstrate in favor of Donald Trump during a process in which electoral votes for the 2020 election, which Trump claimed were based on fraudulent results, were being certified in Washington, DC. Some demonstrators carried QAnon flags. A portion of the crowd marched to the nearby Governor's Mansion, after which a group broke onto the Mansion's grounds, and initially ignored orders to disperse from police who arrived on the scene before being escorted out. Other armed men joined the demonstration outside of the mansion, including a demonstrator with a Hitler Youth knife on his webbing who shouted threats about killing Boomers. No arrests were reported on the day of the demonstration. On 19 January police arrested a man on second-degree assault, felony harassment, and criminal trespassing charges for his actions on 6 January. The man reportedly assaulted two journalists with pepper-spray before threatening to kill a third. Some demonstrators carried firearms.

People chanted, 'Trump, Pence, out now', 'Our city, our streets!', and 'What's that noise, fuck the Proud boys.' A group of demonstrators attacked a woman who was filming the demonstration. Demonstrators reportedly became angry and threw a raw egg at her, hit her with an umbrella, skateboard, sprayed her with aerosol, and rubbed a dirty diaper in her face.

The demonstration turned violent when demonstrators witnessed a man assaulting a Black transgender woman demonstrator. Demonstrators were alleged to have said 'he's a cop!' due to thinking they saw the man, who was actually a photographer for the Daily News, at a previous demonstration. Dozens of demonstrators then surrounded the photographer and began shoving and beating him with their fists and other objects.
